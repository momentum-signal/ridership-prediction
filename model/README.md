# Ridership and High/Low Traffic Prediction

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze and predict **ridership data** for **Komuter** services in Malaysia. The focus is on predicting **high** and **low traffic periods** based on historical ridership patterns. This can help in better planning, optimizing resources, and improving the commuter experience.

### Key Objectives
1. **Ridership Analysis**: Analyze the ridership data from various origins to destinations, focusing on peak and off-peak times.
2. **Traffic Prediction**: Use machine learning techniques to predict periods of high and low ridership. This will be useful for authorities and commuters to better understand travel patterns and prepare accordingly.
3. **Visualization**: Generate visualizations (such as graphs, charts) to represent the trends in ridership and highlight peak traffic periods.

## Data Source

The data for this project is sourced from the official Malaysian government portal for **Komuter Ridership**:
